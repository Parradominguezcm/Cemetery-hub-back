## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

The main thing I wanted to achieve with this project was to gain programming knowledge that doesn't depend on libraries, to get a better understanding on how the different elements fit together.

It is still an ongoing project, but in the future I would like to implement better testing, and possibly stick to Test Driven Development.
